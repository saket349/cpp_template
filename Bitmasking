Set ith bit=> b|(1<<i)

Let's take a problem, given a set, count how many subsets have sum of elements greater than or equal to a given value.

Algorithm is simple:

solve(set, set_size, val)
    count = 0
    for x = 0 to power(2, set_size)
        sum = 0
        for k = 0 to set_size        
            if kth bit is set in x
                sum = sum + set[k]
        if sum >= val
             count = count + 1
    return count
